## 💻 Supported Distributions

Gekkfetch runs on **any Linux distribution** — it’s written in pure C, fast, and portable.

However, only the following distros have dedicated ASCII logos included in the source:

- Arch Linux
    - Manjaro
    - EndeavourOS
- Debian
- Fedora
- Gentoo
- openSUSE
- Ubuntu
    - Linux Mint
- Void

For all other distros, Gekkfetch will gracefully fall back to the classic **Tux** logo 🐧.
